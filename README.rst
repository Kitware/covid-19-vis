COVID-19 Visualization
======================

This currently uses just the John Hopkins CSSE data.

Each dot represents a person.  Only a random proportion of the total population is represented.  The dots are randomly placed in the county of residence.  The sampling control determines how many dots are shown (1 per _sampling_ number in the population).

The counties are shaded based on the highest per-capita values for each data field (transparent is zero, opaque is the highest per-capita value).

This repository includes a development build of `geojs <https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs>`_, which includes some recent pull requests.
